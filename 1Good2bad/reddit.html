    <h1> An Indepth review of Reddit</h1>
    <h2><a href="http://reddit.com">Waste your time here</a></h2>

    <p>Reddit is an interesting site, I often find myself distracted by this website aimlessly scrolling and looking at memes, exploring different subreddit, a community that focuses on one type and just generally wasting my time. Overall, I really enjoy the site I really enjoy the simple colors of red, white and some greys, but one of the biggest and most unqiue features of reddit is how each subreddit has its design and colors, which brings each subreddit is own unqiue feeling. As for design on most pages its very blocky which to me is fine but for others it could be a major problem. That being said some of the time that boxy look and feel is a bit bland, but it is not that large of an issue.</p>

    <p>Navigation is a super simple thing to do on this website, with a quick and easy search bar as well as the ability to customize what you are seeing, there isnt any major issues when it comes to exploring the site. There is a scrolling affect in some capacity, but it does depend in what subreddit/area of the site you are on.</p>

    <p>The code however is very unique, its primarily in html and right off the bat to be perectly honest, i am at a loss for what is occuring, with a combonation of commands i don't know such as table and scrip, but after around a 120 lines of code, things hit the fan where it just becomes these gross blocks of several line worth of code for one command, the thing that is consistent on these weird blocks is source mapping url</p>
