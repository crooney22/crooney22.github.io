    <h1> An Indepth review of MLB</h1>
    <h2><a href="http://mlb.com">Keep yourself updated on MLB</a></h2>

    <p>What can I say, I am the textbook defintion of an arm chair GM, i spend way to much time reading about anyhting i can about the game and that leads to spending a lot of time on this site. The MLB's website is an interesting one, it certianly is the greatest website ever created, but it has some aspects it does quite well, for strartes lets adress the colors, simplistic and natural with the usage of the blue, red and white. However, that being said the background being white and then having a bunch of other things being white, such as box scores, new updates etc. Navigation on this site is quite simple too with links to the teams and their specific sites, the minor leagues, and anything you may need broken up into certian sections.</p>

    <p>Some of the things i really think put this website apart from others that I use are. How smooth it feels to scroll through the sites and the ease of transition between posts. Another simple feature that may go unoticed is how the posts are updates are all curved and look very sleeks and simple. Its simply a website that the MLB uses for their marketing and for news, and i believe it fulfills it's purpose</p>

    <p> The coding on the site is actually insanely simple a lots of divs, meta references to video, pictures and other things. However, most of the code is broken up into div categories.</p>
