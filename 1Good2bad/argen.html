    <h1> An Indepth review of Argen</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://arngren.net">YYou have been warned</a></h2>
    <P>Well what is there to say about this website outside of everything is just bad bad bad. Saying that is a complete understatement. At just a simple glance this site certianly is something. I couldn't even begin to guess what the orginal goal for this website to be. There is just so much wrong going on. In marketing classes we have covered the idea of fear of blank spaces and this websites has a crippling fear of it.</P>

    <p> To put it simply this website is impssiblr to navigate, if you click one link you are taken to another page which makes a huge mess by adding a whole bunch of extra messy links, this website is just plain bad. I'm not sure if this is due to the fact this is a Norwegian website and theres a werid mess in transition or something.</p>

    <p>This website is such a mess it is hard to find a blank space to be able to click and view the page sources. As far as code goes its certainly something. The fact it is even on HTML is surprisng to me. There is a lot of different div classes and other div commands. With other refencess to commands such as table and other things.</p>
    <h2> Lets look at good sites after this one</h2>
