    <h1>Analysis</h1>

    <p>The Iowa state website is simply my favorite. I enjoy eveyr aspect the colors are quite complimentary, its easy to navigate, and with a decent search option along with tabs that breakdown certian things by setions it is quite easy to find things on this website. As for the code it seems to be kind of jumbled at the top, but further down in the code it spaces out. I am interested in seeing what the "meta" command does.</p>
