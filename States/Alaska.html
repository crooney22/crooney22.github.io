    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <p> The Alaskan state website feels like its stuck in the mid 2000's with how ugly it appears. WHile looking at the code i see somethings that i understand but it feels kinda messy with the amount of lists and links spread throught out the website. To be completely and utterly fair althought i ranked the website as the worst, Alaska dosent seem like the state where its website and internet presence is a top priority. Add on to the fact it is also one of the smallest states population wise.</p>
