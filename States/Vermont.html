    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>Vermonts website seems to struggle from the same sort of issues that Oklahoma's website struggled with. Those issues being it seem to be modern in certian aspects and be clunky and old in others. However, that being said it doesn't quite struggle like Oklahoma's did. My biggest dislike of the website is that its seems anything that could've been made into a link was made into a link. As the code stands it seems really messy and there appears to be a ton of it. </p>
