    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p> Overall, I find the Oklahoma site lackluster. It seems to be leaning towards what i expect from a modern website, but parts of it still feels rather clunky. As it stands for the code, it seemed to be very organized and easy to follow. Granted most of the tools and aspects used i have no idea what they are or how they work, the code overall seems to be easy to follow and comprehend.</p>
