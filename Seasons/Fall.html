            <p><img src="fall-tree.png" class="fall">Ahhh fall, if you ask any young kid, myself included, it frankly one of the worst seasons around. The only reason myself and 2nd grades across the nation have this mentality is that with the arrival of fall brings the new school year. However, the begining of fall tends to find this sweet spot between the summer heat and the crispness of a fall breeze, thats if it's a good year. Fall in the emerald city is more of less a wild card, you can get amazing warm fall days that are picturesque or you get that gray skies and rain. So if you plan to visit in the fall bring options for clothing \</p>
