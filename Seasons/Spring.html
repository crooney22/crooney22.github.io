            <p><img src="spring-tree.png" class="spring">The saying goes April showers bring May flowers, well in Seattle its more along the lines of march, april, may and june showers bring summer. Much like fall spring is an absolute wild card when it comes to weather. You could get an amazing warm spring day or you can go four days without seeing the clouds break. Sports in spring are unique though, baseball games getting constantly cancelled isnt out oof the question, our major league team does have a retractable roof for a reason. However, when the sun does break through the clouds it leads to some amazing spring days.</p>
