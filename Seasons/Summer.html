            <p><img src="summser-tree.png" class="summer">If you have suffered through the 3/4 of the year with constant rain the summer is your reward. Without question the best season that graces the area, with amazing blue skiy days that are to die for. This time of year is often reffered to as the trapping period. Indivudals come and fall in love with the weather and the blue skies and amazong scenery. However, they arent aware that 200 days of rain lie ahead. If you are going to viist the 206 doing it during this time its without a doubt the single best time of the year </p>
